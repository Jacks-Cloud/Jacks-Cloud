Greetings! I am Michael Jacks, an engineering student at Iowa State University.

I am personally interested in learning about all things Aerospace!

1. I have used GitHub going on for about 3 years now. I've used it in all sorts of applications from research here at ISU, government side at NASA, to the private sector at Collins it's everywhere! The majority of my experience is with Git Lab but it's pretty much the same as GitHub.

2. I have used Markdown and LaTeX before as well!

- Markdown mostly in demonstration sections of a jupyter notebook. It's really useful when adding descriptions next to code blocks.

- I have had to use LaTeX professionally for my published research paper! All of it was written using MiXTeX and Overleaf as you have almost unlimited control over every aspect of the paper. Formal events and publishing groups have a very specific format they want people to use and LaTeX makes it leaps easier as sometimes it's them sending you a block of LaTeX formatting code and you just throw it into your manuscript.

3. I have also used a few flavors of Linux. Research mostly, we used ArchLinux, Blackhat, Redhat, Ubuntu. The major drive was that it was free and open source. Great for research because people are able to reproduce your results at no cost, (Well mostly if you don't count a computer but Linux can run on raspberry pi's for crying out loud).

4. I hope to learn ways to make my programs more efficient and to learn best practices to speed up slow programs. Nothing is worse than needing to crunch large amounts of data that takes ages.
